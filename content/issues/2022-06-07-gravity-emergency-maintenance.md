On June 7th, 9 PM PST, we will be conducting emergency maintenance on one of our shared hosting servers, Gravity (gravity.cynderhost.com). As a result of this maintenance, your sites / outgoing emails may be unavailable for a period of up to 30 minutes (though it is much more likely to take only ~5 minutes).

This event is meant to address potential hardware issues concerning the stability of the overall server, and thus should not be delayed.
